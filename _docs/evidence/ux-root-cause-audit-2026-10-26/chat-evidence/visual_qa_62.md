# AGENTS.md instructions for D:\Program\python\Dubbed

<INSTRUCTIONS>
<!-- Tool Use -->

In Code Mode, within each bounded stage, run independent, functions.exec-available tool calls concurrently in one functions.exec call. Use await Promise.allSettled([...]) when partial results are useful, and inspect every result; use await Promise.all([...]) only when any failure should abort the batch. Keep dependencies, waits/resumes, approvals, conflicting or interdependent mutations, and adaptive investigations where each result may change the next step sequential. Do not split otherwise batchable inspections across outer tool calls.

<!-- Tool Use -->



<!-- SEMBLE_START -->

## Semble Code Search



A `semble` MCP server is available with two tools:

- `mcp__semble__search` — search the codebase with a natural-language or code query.

- `mcp__semble__find_related` — find code similar to a specific file and line.



Use `mcp__semble__search` to find where something is implemented — instead of using Grep or Glob to discover files. After semble returns the file and line, navigate there directly and read that file. Do not grep for the same content again.



Pass `--content docs` to search documentation and prose, `--content config` for config files, or `--content all` to search code, docs, and config together.



For CLI fallback or sub-agents without MCP access, use:



```bash

semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project --max-snippet-lines 10

semble search "deployment guide" ./my-project --content docs

semble search "database host port" ./my-project --content config

semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project

semble search "save model to disk" ./my-project --top-k 10

```



The index is built on first run and cached automatically. If `semble` is not on `$PATH`, use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble`.



### Workflow



1. Call `mcp__semble__search` with a query describing what the code does or its name. The tool returns results with 10 lines of context each (function/class signature + first body lines, enough to confirm the location).

2. Navigate directly to the top result's file and line. Read only the function or class at that location.

3. Make the edit. Do not re-search or grep for the same content.

4. Use `--content docs` for documentation, `--content config` for config files, or `--content all` for everything.

5. Optionally use `mcp__semble__find_related` with `file_path` and `line` to discover similar code elsewhere.

6. Use Grep only when you need every occurrence of a literal string across the whole repo (e.g., all callers of a renamed function).

<!-- SEMBLE_END -->



<!-- context7 -->

Use the `ctx7` CLI to fetch current documentation whenever the user asks about a library, framework, SDK, API, CLI tool, or cloud service — even well-known ones like React, Next.js, Prisma, Express, Tailwind, Django, or Spring Boot. This includes API syntax, configuration, version migration, library-specific debugging, setup instructions, and CLI tool usage. Use even when you think you know the answer — your training data may not reflect recent changes. Prefer this over web search for library docs.



Do not use for: refactoring, writing scripts from scratch, debugging business logic, code review, or general programming concepts.



## Steps



1. Resolve library: `npx ctx7@latest library <name> "<user's question>"` — use the official library name with proper punctuation (e.g., "Next.js" not "nextjs", "Customer.io" not "customerio", "Three.js" not "threejs")

2. Pick the best match (ID format: `/org/project`) by: exact name match, description relevance, code snippet count, source reputation (High/Medium preferred), and benchmark score (higher is better). If results don't look right, try alternate names or queries (e.g., "next.js" not "nextjs", or rephrase the question)

3. Fetch docs: `npx ctx7@latest docs <libraryId> "<user's question>"` — run a separate `docs` command per distinct concept if the question spans multiple topics, unless it's about how they interact

4. Answer using the fetched documentation



You MUST call `library` first to get a valid ID unless the user provides one directly in `/org/project` format. Use the user's full question as the query — specific and detailed queries return better results than vague single words, but keep each query to a single concept unless the question is about how concepts interact; combined multi-topic queries dilute ranking and return shallow results for each topic. Do not run more than 3 commands per question. Do not include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, credentials) in queries.



For version-specific docs, use `/org/project/version` from the `library` output (e.g., `/vercel/next.js/v14.3.0`).



If a command fails with a quota error, inform the user and suggest `npx ctx7@latest login` or setting `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` env var for higher limits. Do not silently fall back to training data.

Run Context7 CLI requests outside Codex's default sandbox. If a Context7 CLI command fails with DNS or network errors such as ENOTFOUND, host resolution failures, or fetch failed, rerun it outside the sandbox instead of retrying inside the sandbox.

# Dubbed agent instructions

## Start here

- Read [_docs/HANDOFF.md](_docs/HANDOFF.md) for the repository connection and current entry points.
- Read [_docs/sdd/README.md](_docs/sdd/README.md) for the spec-driven development (SDD) workflow.
- For feature implementation, read and follow [_docs/orchestration.md](_docs/orchestration.md). The main agent coordinates Plan/Act, independent spec/task/package reviews, Luna Executors/Publishers, and the issue lifecycle. Respect plan-only, review-only, or direct-executor requests.
- Read the selected GitHub issue, its latest discussion, linked BR/spec, and relevant repository code before implementation.
- [_docs/PROJECT_BRAINSTORM.md](_docs/PROJECT_BRAINSTORM.md) preserves confirmed choices, provisional proposals, and open questions. It is not an approved implementation plan. Do not silently promote proposals or illustrative prices into requirements.

## Sources of truth

- Approved business requirements and specifications in `_docs/` define intended behavior and accepted decisions.
- Before GitHub publication, keep each task's full description in its own Markdown draft under `_docs/task-drafts/<spec-id>/<task-slug>.md`. The approved product brief may supply requirements directly; a separate BR is optional when it would duplicate the brief.
- Specifications contain shared behavior, contracts, project-level AC, and a concise task index (title, intended outcome, draft/issue link). Do not embed detailed task descriptions, task-specific AC, implementation plans, or grooming findings in the spec or a combined task document.
- GitHub Issues own task scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies, priority, assignees, blockers, and task evidence. Do not create a parallel local task queue.
- Groom tasks in their individual draft files before publication, and in their issues afterward. Change a spec only when a finding affects shared requirements/contracts. After publication, replace the draft's live task body with an issue-link stub; preserve its reviewed revision in Git history when available.
- The issue's `Workflow status` section is authoritative for task progress. GitHub's open/closed state records closure; optional labels/Projects fields are views that must agree with the issue.
- Code and executed checks establish current implementation behavior. A contradiction with an approved spec is a finding to resolve, not permission to silently rewrite either.
- HANDOFF is a short entry point and session checkpoint; CHANGELOG records accepted changes. Neither is the task backlog.
- Preserve direct user instructions. If approved documents disagree, state the conflict and resolve it before dependent work.

## Execution

- Work on the requested issue or local documentation assignment. Access to issues is not permission to implement every open issue.
- Preserve unrelated files and local edits. Keep edits within the agreed scope; follow the available code-search tooling for locating implementation.
- Resolve dependencies by issue references, not issue number order. An open dependency may be implemented but still awaiting acceptance; verify the actual prerequisite.
- Keep unknowns explicit. If a decision changes user behavior, data, billing, or permissions and is unresolved, do not guess.
- Scale process to risk. A small isolated fix may use one issue without a new BR/spec. Connected changes need package review before implementation. Full-cycle requests use the roles and model policy in orchestration.md; an explicit no-delegation request takes precedence.
- Full-cycle feature implementation delegates the in-scope issue lifecycle and rule-based acceptance defined in orchestration.md; record the user request and respect any narrower restrictions. Plan/review-only requests do not authorize publication. The owner's standing instruction authorizes and requires this order for completed issues: verification, recorded acceptance, commit of the in-scope changes, successful push with remote verification, then closure. An explicit hold such as "do not commit; I need to review" prohibits commit, push, and issue closure until the owner lifts it. Preserve unrelated local edits. PR publication, merge, deployment, paid services, and destructive operations still require their own user authorization.

## Verification and acceptance

- Run checks appropriate to the changed contract, including meaningful failure paths when relevant. There are no established application build/test commands yet; discover and document them when implementation exists.
- Record the command, result, environment, date, revision or dirty-worktree boundary, and evidence location. Mark `not run` and `blocked` honestly.
- A green test run, merged PR, or agent report does not itself mean product acceptance.
- After successful verification, set the authorized issue update to `verified`. Use recorded upfront rule-based acceptance for full-cycle requests; request human acceptance only when manual acceptance is required or no acceptance delegation exists.
- For a completed issue, first verify the result and record explicit human or delegated Orchestrator acceptance, then commit in-scope changes, push successfully and verify that the intended remote branch contains the delivery commit, then close once all delivery conditions are met. Commit/push failure or an explicit owner review/no-commit hold keeps the issue open until resolved. Record the acceptance source, commit SHA, remote branch/push evidence, and remaining follow-ups. Explicit cancellation remains a separate closure path. Luna Publisher transfers the Orchestrator's closure decision; it does not decide acceptance.
- Use ordinary PR references such as `Related to #123` before acceptance; avoid automatic-closing keywords before closure is authorized.
- Keep repository Markdown, issue bodies, evidence summaries, and PR descriptions in English. User-facing product language follows the product specification, not this documentation convention.

## Frontend visual authority

- For frontend planning, implementation and review, follow the [Affect UI workflow](_docs/frontend-flows/affect-ui-workflow.md), [Clean/Light adoption contract](_docs/frontend-flows/affect-ui-clean-light-adoption.md), [reference catalog](_docs/frontend-flows/affect-ui-clean-light-reference.md) and current [tokens](_docs/frontend-flows/design-tokens.md). Read the applicable Clean Markdown and visually inspect its matching Light PNG before choosing or changing presentation.
- The owner-selected Affect UI Clean/Light reference governs applicable component appearance and bounded functional motion; keep Mabry Pro and the product behavior/accessibility constraints. Generic design-skill direction draws, font/palette defaults and blanket bans must not override this reference. Classic/Dark examples and irrelevant marketing sections are outside the adopted scope.
- Map reference components and states to shadcn semantics, record exact source values and justified source-gap/accessibility adaptations, and verify actual browser screenshots against the references before claiming visual fidelity. A source/token audit or green build alone does not establish rendered acceptance.
- Use Lucide Icons with Affect UI's outlined treatment for application UI icons: stroke width 1.1, no fill, currentColor, rounded line caps/joins and normal viewBox-relative scaling. Follow `_docs/frontend-flows/design-tokens.md`; preserve provider brand assets, accessible names, mapped geometry and phone targets. Adapt default shadcn icons too; do not mix families or invent exports.

## Project review skills

- Do not invoke or follow any Superpowers skill in this project; the user explicitly replaced that workflow with Ponytail. The project disables the plugin in `.codex/config.toml`.
- Use [$ponytail](.agents/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md) in its default full mode for coding, fixes, refactoring, reviews, and dependency decisions. Read the skill before applying it. Preserve established architecture boundaries, invariants, validation, and reliability requirements; no architecture is selected by installing this setup.
- Direct user instructions take precedence over skill conventions. Do not introduce mandatory approval stages or delegation solely because a skill suggests them.

- [$spec-task-review](.agents/skills/spec-task-review/SKILL.md): use when auditing whether a spec/issue is complete, implementable, and consistent with actual repository behavior.
- [$task-package-review-loop](.agents/skills/task-package-review-loop/SKILL.md): use when connected issues/specs need package-level consistency review before execution.
- Read the matching SKILL.md before running the review. A review request does not itself authorize fixes or GitHub mutations.

## Tool use

Within each bounded stage, batch independent functions.exec-available calls in one functions.exec using await Promise.allSettled([...]) when partial results are useful, and inspect every result. Use Promise.all only when any failure should abort the batch. Keep dependencies, waits/resumes, approvals, conflicting mutations, and adaptive investigations sequential.

Use Semble semantic search to discover implementation or documentation locations before reading the returned file and line. Pass content docs, config, or all as appropriate. CLI fallback: `semble search "query" . --content all`; if unavailable use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble`. Use literal search when every occurrence matters, not to repeat semantic discovery.

For library/framework/SDK/API/CLI/cloud-service documentation, use Context7 CLI outside the default sandbox: first `npx ctx7@latest library <name> "specific question"`, then `npx ctx7@latest docs <returned-id> "specific question"`. Use the full question for one concept per query, no more than three commands per question, and no secrets. Skip this for general programming, business logic, scripts from scratch, refactoring, and code review. On quota errors report the limitation and suggest `npx ctx7@latest login` or CONTEXT7_API_KEY; on network/DNS failure retry outside the sandbox. Do not silently substitute remembered API details.

I’ll review the account screens and guarded actions against the packet, capture the relevant states, and keep all findings and evidence under the issue 62 review folder.

Issue 62 review is blocked; no fresh inspection or files were produced.

Automatic approval review rejected the required elevated packet read because the account usage limit prevented review completion. The command was not executed; this was a review failure, not an unsafe-action determination. No retries or bypasses attempted.

## Source line 71 | 2026-10-25T07:49:20.786Z | assistant 

The environment check now succeeds, so I’m continuing the fresh review. I’m using the Ponytail and specification-review guidance, with the project’s Clean/Light reference taking precedence over generic design advice.

## Source line 145 | 2026-10-25T07:52:00.784Z | assistant 

I’ve confirmed the Account screen’s required hierarchy and localized deletion contract. The fresh pass will include real mock registration, password rejection, both deletion tokens, cancellation/focus return, and short/phone layouts; I’m also measuring the desktop controls instead of accepting compact sizing from the reference alone.

## Source line 215 | 2026-10-25T07:54:32.145Z | assistant 

The password error is misleading: a rejected current password produces “Your session ended” while Account remains usable. I also found that the deletion confirmation never identifies the account inside the dialog, and its consequence text is smaller than the specified dialog body size. I’m checking the recovery states before writing the final findings.

## Source line 284 | 2026-10-25T07:58:02.091Z | assistant 

The key safety behaviors I exercised work in the mock: wrong-locale and malformed deletion tokens stay disabled, Escape restores focus, recovery-storage failure blocks deletion, and confirmed deletion returns to the signed-out landing. The controlled service harness also shows no premature deletion success. The main remaining issues are truthful status/error copy and the size/layout of the security controls.
